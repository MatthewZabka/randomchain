There have been a variety of attempts to randomize topological constructions.
Most famously, Erd\"os and R\'enyi introduced a model for random
graphs~\cite{erdos_random_1959, erdos_evolution_1960}.  This work spawned an
entire industry of probabilistic models and tools used for understanding other
random topological and algebraic phenomenon. These include various models for
random simplicial complexes, random networks, and many more. Further, this has
led to beautiful connections with statistical physics, for example through
percolation theory\mc{Add a lot of citations to this intro.}.  Our ultimate goal 
is to understand higher dimensional topological constructions from a random perspective. We 
begin with a much simpler objective of understanding an algebraic
by-product of topological spaces, known as a chain complex. 

Chain complexes are algebraic constructions used to measure a variety of
different properties. Their usefulness lies in providing a pathway for
homological algebra computations. They arise in a variety of contexts,
including commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, group cohomology, Hoschild homology, de Rham
cohomology, and of course algebraic topology. Specifically, chain
complexes measure the relationship between cycles and boundaries of a
topological space. This relationship underlies many topological properties of
interest, and is precisely what homology reveals. 

The singular chain complex of a topological space provides a canonical
chain complex.
If the topological space has additional structure, like a CW or 
simplicial decomposition, then the singular chain complex can be replaced
by CW or simplicial chains, which are much easier to compute.

%Topology's tools have become very popular for analyzing data, and as one
%usually regards data as a random vector, some have attempted to apply
%randomness to topological ideas.  For example, Ginzburg and Pasechnik
%\cite{ginzburg2017random} have investigated a random chain complex with
%constant differential, while Zabka \cite{zabka2018random} has investigated a
%random Bockstein operator.  Both of these papers have investigated their topics
%in a strictly algebraic setting, and in this paper, we too shall investigate a
%random chain complex in a strictly algebraic setting.
%
%Chain complexes arise in topology as an algebraic measure in different
%dimensions of the relationship between the cycles and boundaries of a
%topological space. In particular, a chain complex defined on a space gives us a
%way to calculate that space's homology groups.


Let $R$ be a ring. A {\em chain complex $C_*=(C_m, \delta_m)$ with coefficients in
$R$} is a sequence of $R$-modules, denoted $C_m$, together with a sequence of
linear transformations 
\[
  \cdots \xrightarrow{\delta_{m+1}} C_m \xrightarrow{\delta_m}
  C_{m-1} \xrightarrow{\delta_{m-1}} \cdots
\]
such that $\delta_{m-1}\delta_m = 0$ for all $m \in \Z$. The maps $\delta_m$
are called the boundary maps of the chain complex, and the equation
$\delta_{m-1} \delta_m = 0$ is known as the boundary condition;
see~\cite{hatcher2002algebraic} for further details.

The boundary condition $A_{m-1}A_m=0$ forces $\im A_m \subseteq \ker A_{m-1}$.
The {\em homology} of a chain complex measures the deviation of this containment
from equality:
\begin{equation*}
  \label{eqn:hom}
  H_m(C_*;R) = \frac{\ker A_{m-1}}{\im A_m} \, .
\end{equation*}
When the chain complex arises from singular chains on a topological
space, the homology is a very powerful tool in algebraic 
topology \mc{Add citations}.

We work over the field with $q$-elements $R = \Fqn{}$ throughout. In this setting, 
homology can be understood in terms of dimension
\begin{equation*}
  \beta_m := \dim_{\Fqn{}} \frac{\ker A_{m-1}}{\im A_m} \, ,
  \label{eqn:betti_numbers}
\end{equation*}
where $\beta_m$ is known as the $m^\mathrm{th}$ {\em Betti number}.

%Formally, a {\em chain complex $(C_n, \delta_n)$ } is a sequence of modules,
%denoted $C_n$, and a sequence of linear transformations $\delta_n : C_n \to
%C_{n-1}$ that satisfy the `boundary' condition $\delta_{n-1}\delta_n = 0$ for
%all $n$. The $\delta_n$ are usually called the boundary maps of the chain
%complex. An interested reader can see \cite{hatcher2002algebraic} for further
%details.
%
%Let $q$ be a prime number and let $\Fq$ denote the field with $q$ elements.
%Consider the sequence of vector spaces $\Fqn{n_m}$ indexed by $m$ in the
%integers.  Let $A_m$ be a random sequence of $(n_{m-1})\times (n_m)$ matrices
%whose entries are chosen i.i.d. uniformly from $\Fq$, subject to the condition
%that the product of consecutive matrices is zero.  We then consider the random
%chain complex $(\Fqn{n_m},A_m)$. That is, we consider
%\[
%  \cdots \stackrel{A_{m+1}}{\lra} \Fqn{n_m} \stackrel{A_m}{\lra} \Fqn{n_{m-1}} 
%  \stackrel{A_{m-1}}{\lra} \cdots 
%\]
%where $A_{i+1}A_i=0$ for every $i$. 

% \mc{Do we need an iterative construction like this? I don't think so:
% people work with unbounded chain complexes all the time. Equivalently,
% building a $\Z$-graded chain complex doesn't rely on an induction or anything.
% E.g.: take $C_n = R$ for all $n \in \Z$ and take all the maps to be zero. 
% This is a perfectly good chain complex that doesn't \emph{start} anywhere.
% This would allow us to define a more general object, even if we never work
% with it.}

\subsection*{Main Results}
Let $q$ be a prime number.  We
build a random chain complex with coefficients in $\Fqn{}$ as follows (see
Definition~\ref{defn:random_chain_cx} for a precise statement). Given a
sequence of integers $(n_m)$, where $m \in \N$, together with a probability
distribution $\varphi$ on $\Fqn{}$, we construct 
linear transformations 
\[
  A_m : \Fqn{n_m} \lra \Fqn{n_{m-1}} \, ,
\]
for all $m$. The transformations are subject to the constraint $A_{m-1} A_m =
0$, and should be chosen according to $\varphi$. The latter means the
following: after fixing the standard basis for $\Fqn{n_m}$, it suffices to
construct random $n_{m-1} \times n_m$ matrices $A_m$, satisfying $A_{m-1}A_m =
0$. We do so by choosing matrix entries i.i.d. from the distribution $\varphi$
on $\Fqn{}$.\mc{Add exposition about models for random chain complexes.}

We are primarily interested in the case when $\varphi \equiv \tfrac1q$ is
the uniform distribution on $\Fqn{}$. In this case, we say
$(\Fqn{}, A_m)$ is a {\em uniform random chain complex}.


Our first result is an explicit formula for the distribution
of the Betti numbers.
\begin{bigthm} 
  \label{thm:bettinum}
  Let $\beta_j$ be the $j$-th Betti number of a uniform random chain complex
  $(\Fq^{n} , A_m)$. Then
  \[    
    \bP[\beta_j = b] = \sum_{i_j=0}^{n_{j}} P_{i_j}^{j}(i_j-b)
    \sum_{i_{j-1}=0}^{n_{j-1}} P_{i_{j-1}}^{j-1}\left(n_{j} -i_j\right) \cdots
    \sum_{i_1 = 0}^{n_1} P_{i_1}^1\left(n_2 - i_2\right) P_{n_0}^0 \left(n_1 - i_1\right) \, ,
  \]
  where $P^m_k(r)$ is given in Eq.~\eqref{eqn:Pmkr}.
\end{bigthm}

\mc{Explain why thm A is good.}

Our second main result shows that as $q \ra \infty$, the homology of a 
random chain complex tends to its minimal value. Set
\begin{equation*}
  (n)_+ = \max(0,n) \, \, \mbox{ and } \, \, (n)_- = \min(0,n) \, ,
\end{equation*}
to be the {\em positive part} and {\em negative part} of $n$, respectively.
Define
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
  N_m &= \left( (-1)^{m+1}n_m + \left( (-1)^{m}n_{m-1} + \left( \cdots(-n_2 + (n_1+ (-n_0)_-)_+ )_- \cdots \right)_{\pm} \right)_{\mp} \right)_+ \\
    &=\left( (-1)^{m+1}n_m + \left( (-1)^m n_{m-1} + \left( \cdots(-n_2 + (n_1 -n_0)_+ )_- \cdots \right)_{\pm} \right)_{\mp} \right)_+
\end{aligned}
  \label{eqn:Nm}
\end{equation}


\begin{bigthm}
  \label{thm:qtoinfty}
  For a uniform random chain complex $(\Fqn{n_m},A_m)$ with $N_m$ defined as in Eq.~\eqref{eqn:Nm},
  \[
    \bP[\beta_m = N_m] \ra 1 
    \mbox{ as } q \ra \infty  \, .
  \]
\end{bigthm}

\mc{The following remarks need to be re-written and substantiated.}
\begin{remark}
  \label{rem:smallest}
  The number $N_m$ of Theorem~\ref{thm:qtoinfty} represents the smallest
  possible value of $\beta_m$. Therefore, we interpret Theorem~\ref{thm:qtoinfty}
  as the statement that the rank of the homology is minimal as 
  $q \ra \infty$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  \label{rem:monotone}
  As a special case of the above theorem, consider when $\{n_m\}$
  is monotonic, e.g., constant or increasing. In this case, 
  $N_m = 0$, and the homology is trivial in probability as $q \ra \infty$.
\end{remark}

\subsection*{Related Work} There are other notions of random chain complex
one could consider. In~\cite{ginzburg2017random}, Ginzburg and Pasechnik investigate
a different notion of random chain complex than the one described above.
Given a finite dimensional vector space $V$ over $\Fqn{}$, they consider chain
complexes of the form
\[
  \cdots \stackrel{D}{\lra} V \stackrel{D}{\lra} V \stackrel{D}{\lra} \cdots \, \, ,
\]
for a randomly chosen linear operator $D$ such that $D^2 = 0$. They choose the 
operator $D$ uniformly over all such possible choices. 

The first of their main results~\cite[Thm 2.1]{ginzburg2017random} states that
$\bP[\beta_r > 0] \ra 0$ as $q \ra \infty$ for $r>1$. Furthermore, $\bP[\beta_0
= 0] \ra 1$ ($n$-even) or $\bP[\beta_1 = 0] \ra 1$ ($n$-odd) as $q \ra \infty$.
One interpretation of this result is that homology concentrates in the
lowest possible dimension as $q \ra \infty$ (depending on the parity of $n$).
This result is a special case of Theorem~\ref{thm:qtoinfty} where $n_m \equiv
n$ for all $m$ (c.f.  Remark~\ref{rem:monotone}).

Their second main result~\cite[Thm 2.2]{ginzburg2017random} shows that 
the following limit exists and is bounded
\[
  0 < \lim_{n \ra \infty} \bP[\beta_r = j] < 1 \, ,
\]
for all $r$ and $j$. Based on explicit bounds, they provide analytic
formulas for the quantity $\lim_{n\ra \infty}\bP[\beta_j=r]$ in terms
of $r$ and $j$. In our situation, we interpret $n \ra \infty$ as the case
$n_m \ra \infty$ and consider $\beta_M$ for large $M$. In theory,
one can analyze this quantity using Theorem~\ref{thm:bettinum},
but we have not been able to obtain useful bounds.

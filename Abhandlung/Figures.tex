Here we put some figures.

The colors in the figures all follow the following scheme:

$\beta_1$ is blue, $\beta_2$ is red, $\beta_3$ is green, $\beta_4$ is orange,
$\beta_5$ is brown, $\beta_6$ is yellow, $\beta_7$ is pink.

I have removed all the figures from this file and I'll add them soon.
